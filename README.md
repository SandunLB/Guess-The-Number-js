# Guess My Number!

Welcome to the **Guess My Number!** game, a fun and interactive web application built for entertainment and educational purposes. Test your guessing skills and see how high you can score!

## Features

- **Dynamic Difficulty Levels**: Adjust the difficulty from Easy (1-20), Medium (1-50), to Hard (1-100), which changes the range of possible numbers and the initial score.
- **Timer**: Challenge yourself with a 60-second timer. The game ends when the timer runs out or you guess the number correctly.

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
